# Designing for Trust on Social Media

## Description

This website was originally created for an iSchool Senior Capstone project. It showcases our conducted research as well as a toolkit based off that research, which is a resource for designers to learn more about design features social media platforms use to build trust.

You can find the live site [here](https://social-media-trust.netlify.app/).
